        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>For the past decade, I have worked on a small team to manage all marketing efforts for a national bar and grill chain. This included all monthly promotional features and events from concept to completion, photography and videography, menu engineering and design, collateral, digital content, social media advertising and more. My dedication to creating visual appealing designs propelled me into leadership roles in creative direction, while my attention to detail allowed me to successfully lead digital content management and advertising efforts.</p>
        <p>In addition to my professional skills, I understand the ways in which our enviroments shape and can be shaped by our individual contributions. Because of this, I am an active member in my community - working with others as an artist, nonprofit board member and community organizer to create programs and events that cultivate stewardship, inclusion, diversity, creativity in a thriving community.</p>

        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>I am proficient in using Adobe Creative Suites, DSLR cameras, Hootsuite, Sprout Social and Google Workspaces. I have never hesitated to master additional software based on the needs of my team. I have spent the past year acquiring proficiency in Figma, Adobe XD and UI/UX Fundamentals by enrolling in reputable online courses such as Coursera.org, TeamTreeHouse.com and Udemy.com.</p>
